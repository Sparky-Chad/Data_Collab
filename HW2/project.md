##members
range - two ints which define the range of values the wheel can output, should remain constant throughout the game only changing when created, keep as a protected value for a potential overloaded function in hard mode

## Functions
compare(int in) - compares the int to a new random value generated by the wheel, return bool, true if random int is greater, false if random int is less than

spin(), return int within inclusive bounds of the wheel

possibly work on a hard mode which can change its bounds depending on if it has won or lost?
